httpio
======

HTTP resources as random-access file-like objects

httpio is a small Python library that allows you to access files served over
HTTP as file-like_ objects. It differs from libraries like ``urllib`` and
``requests`` in that it supports ``seek()`` (which moves an internal pointer),
and that ``read()`` makes a request with the ``Range`` header set. It also
supports caching of contents using a configurable block size, and will reuse
TCP connections where possible.

Installation
------------

Use ``pip`` to install httpio:

.. code-block:: console

    $ pip install httpio

Usage
-----

.. code-block:: python

    import zipfile
    import httpio

    url = "http://some/large/file.zip"
    with httpio.open(url) as fp:
        zf = zipfile.ZipFile(fp)
        print(zf.namelist())
